# Combining Signals for Enhanced Alpha

In this project, I combined signals on a random forest for enhanced alpha. While implementing this, I had to solve the problem of overlapping samples. For the dataset, I used the end of day from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar.

This project was the seventh project (out of Eight Projects) in **AI for trading NanoDegree Program**, offered by Udacity. The rest of projects could be found in my GitHub Page as well.
